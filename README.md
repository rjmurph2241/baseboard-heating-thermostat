# ESPHome Based Line Voltage (Baseboard) Thermostat From Wall Switch
I recently wanted to add smart thermostats to my apartment.  However, I was supprised by the lack of inexpensive, line voltage (or baseboard) smart thermostats.  Especially since there's so many cheap smart wall switches, and a line voltage thermostat is just a wall switch with a temperature sensor and some type of UI.  So I decided to make some.
